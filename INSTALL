Installation is easy; cd to the src/ directory, then type this:

./configure
make
make install

If you put the readline library in a non standard location, you can
do a ./configure --includedir=<location> --libdir=<location>/readline to 
specify it. For example, if you put the readline library in /tmp/readline, 
you can do

./configure --includedir=/tmp --libdir=/tmp/readline


Options configure current supports:
--includedir    Additional include directory
--bindir        Location you want tt++ to be installed (default is the src dir)
--libdir	Addition library directory
--enable-big5   To use the big5 encoding

If you wish, you can edit src/Makefile.in before running ./configure.
It shouldn't be necessary unless you have some unorthodox request
(such as wanting to install tintin++ and its help file in /usr/local).

If you have any trouble with installing/compiling tintin, you can use
the gripe command in src/ directory to send email.  Please include
the OS, compiler and the error message that you have.  Or you can email
us at tintin@newclear.net.
