*NOTE* this doc is probably out of date as I (rohan) have compiled
readline without any problems on an Irix machine.  I'll keep this
doc here for now, but the information is probably out of date (as 
of readline version 4.0).

For some reason, the Gnu readline distribution doesn't compile
out of the box on Irix (sgi boxes).  I could change the Gnu
dist to fix this, but I don't really want to...

So here's what you should do to compile tintin++ on a sgi.
First, cd to src/readline and edit Makefile.in.  Change the
line which says

DEFS = @DEFS@

to read

DEFS = @DEFS@ -D_BSD_SIGNALS

Now cd back to src/ and run

./configure
make

as normal.  This should work.  If not, please send me email
using the gripe command.  Sorry 'bout that!
